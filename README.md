**📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project predicts stock prices of major Indian companies using Support Vector Regression (SVR).

**🔍 Overview**

Historical stock data from the past 3 years was used to train a machine learning model that forecasts the next day’s closing price. The project demonstrates how ML can be applied to financial time-series data.

**🗂 Dataset**

Daily stock prices (NSE companies)

Feature used: Closing Price

Data cleaned and converted into numerical format for modeling

**⚙️ Technologies**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (SVR)

Google Colab

**🤖 Model**

Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel was used after scaling the data to improve performance.

**📊 Workflow**

Load & clean stock data

Convert dates to numeric values

Scale features

Train SVR model

Predict next day price

Visualize results

**🚀 Output**

The model provides a predicted stock price based on past trends.

This project is for learning purposes. Stock markets are unpredictable and results are not financial advice.
